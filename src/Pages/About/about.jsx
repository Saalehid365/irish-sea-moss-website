        <h3>About us</h3>
        <p>
          We are a family owned business with ties to the Caribbean and Africa.
          Thanks to Millie, Sea moss has been an integral part of our family
          since the 1970's. She introduced the benefits of Seamoss to us by
          making the tasty drink Irish moss regularly, which was enjoyed by all!
          As a family, we aspire to a healthy lifestyle and now wish to share
          our wonderful experience of Sea moss with you by introducing you to
          our range of quality sourced products. inspired by Millie.
